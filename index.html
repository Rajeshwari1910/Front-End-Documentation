            What is HTML?
HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language.
It is used to create webpages by defining their structure and formatting.
HTML uses tags and attributes to describe how content should be displayed.

          </p>

          <p>
            Features of HTML:
Easy to learn and use: HTML has a straightforward syntax.
Platform-independent: It works across different devices and browsers.
Supports multimedia: You can add images, videos, and audio to web pages.
Hypertext: HTML allows you to create links between pages.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              HTML consists of predefined tags and elements.
An element includes an opening tag, some content, and a closing tag.
Remember to include closing tags; otherwise, the browser applies the effect of the opening tag until the end of the page.
            </li>
            <li>
              Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying
              objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example,
              server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a
              database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to
              another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a
              server.

            You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in
            identifiers. You can also use the Unicode escape sequences as
            characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are
            Number_hits, temp99, and _name.

            Disadvantages of HTML
HTML can only create static web pages. For dynamic web pages, other languages have to be used.
A large amount of code has to be written to create a simple web page.
The security feature is not good.
Conclusion
In conclusion, mastering HTML is a fundamental step in your web development journey. This guide serves as a comprehensive resource for understanding HTML, from the basics to more advanced topics. Remember, HTML is more than just a markup language – it’s a powerful tool for creating engaging,
 accessible, and SEO-friendly websites.

            Web Browsers
Unlike other programming languages, HTML does not show output on the compiler.

Web browsers show the results of an HTML code. It reads HTML files and determines how to show content with the help of HTML tags.

Any web browser (Google, Safari, Mozilla Firefox, etc) can be used to open a . HTML file and view the results.

Why learn HTML?
It is a simple markup language. Its implementation is easy.
It is used to create a website.
Helps in developing fundamentals about web programming.
Boost professional career.
HTML History
HTML is a markup language used by the browser to manipulate text, images, and other content, in order to display it in the required format. HTML was created by Tim Berners-Lee in 1991. The first-ever version of HTML was HTML 1.0, but the first standard version was HTML 2.0, published in 1995.

Currently, we are using HTML5, which is the latest and most recent version of HTML.

         <article>
            <p>
            1.  What is CSS?
CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.
It is a language used to style web pages by defining how HTML elements should be displayed on screen, paper, or other media.
CSS allows you to control the layout, colors, fonts, spacing, and other visual aspects of your website.

            </p>

              CSS Demo - One HTML Page - Multiple Styles!
              Here we will show one HTML page displayed with four different stylesheets.
               Click on the "Stylesheet 1", "Stylesheet 2", "Stylesheet 3", "Stylesheet 4" links below to see the different styles:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Why Use CSS?
CSS is used to define styles for your web pages,
 including the design, layout and variations in display for different devices and screen sizes.

CSS Example ...body {
  background-color: lightblue;
}

h1 {
  color: white;
  text-align: center;
}

p {
  font-family: verdana;
  font-size: 20px;
}

              </li>
              <li>
                CSS Solved a Big Problem
HTML was NEVER intended to contain tags for formatting a web page!

HTML was created to describe the content of a web page, like:

<h1>This is a heading</h1>

<p>This is a paragraph.</p>

When tags like <font>, and color attributes were added to the HTML 3.2 specification, it started a nightmare for web developers. Development of large websites, where fonts and color information were added to every single page, became a long and expensive process.

To solve this problem, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) created CSS.

CSS removed the style formatting from the HTML page!

              p is a selector in CSS (it points to the HTML element you want to style: <p>).
              color is a property, and red is the property value
              text-align is a property, and center is the property value

          <h2>CSS Selectors</h2>
          <article>
            <p>
              CSS Selectors
CSS selectors are used to "find" (or select) the HTML elements you want to style.

We can divide CSS selectors into five categories:

Simple selectors (select elements based on name, id, class)
Combinator selectors (select elements based on a specific relationship between them)
Pseudo-class selectors (select elements based on a certain state)
Pseudo-elements selectors (select and style a part of an element)
Attribute selectors (select elements based on an attribute or attribute value)
This page will explain the most basic CSS selectors.

              It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment
              (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the
              objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over
              them.
            </p>
  
            <p>
              JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array,
              Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as
              operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can
              be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with
              additional objects; for example:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying
                objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM).
                For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place
                elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse
                clicks, form input, and page navigation.
              </li>
              <li>
                Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying
                objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example,
                server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a
                database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to
                another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a
                server.

          <h2>Hello world</h2>
          <article>
            To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write
            your first "Hello world" JavaScript code:
            <code
              >function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }
              greetMe("World");
            </code>
  
            Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your
            browser!
          <h2>Variables</h2>
          <article>
            <p>
              You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application.
              The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain
              rules.
            </p>
            <p>
              A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or
              dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9).
              Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters
              "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z"
              (lowercase).
            </p>
            <p>
              You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in
              identifiers. You can also use the Unicode escape sequences as
              characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are
              Number_hits, temp99, and _name.
              <h2>JavaScript and Java</h2>
          <article>
            <p>
              JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally
              different in some others. The JavaScript language resembles Java but
              does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking.
              JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions
              and basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was
              renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.
            </p>
  
            <p>
              In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by
              declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system based on a small
              number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string
              values. JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the
              more common class-based object model. The prototype-based model
              provides dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary
              for individual objects. JavaScript also supports functions without
              any special declarative requirements. Functions can be properties of
              objects, executing as loosely typed methods.
            </p>
            <p>
              JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not
              have to declare all variables, classes, and methods. You do not have
              to be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or
              protected, and you do not have to implement interfaces. Variables,
              parameters, and function return types are not explicitly typed.
